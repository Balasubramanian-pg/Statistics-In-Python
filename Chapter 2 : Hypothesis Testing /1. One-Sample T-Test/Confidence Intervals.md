## 9. Confidence Intervals: The Inverse View

A one-sample t-test corresponds exactly to a confidence interval for the mean.

If the hypothesized mean lies outside the 95% CI:
• The test is significant at α = 0.05

Confidence intervals are often more informative because they show:

• Direction
• Magnitude
• Uncertainty

Think of hypothesis testing as a special case of estimation.
