## 3. The Test Statistic (What Is Actually Being Computed)

The one-sample t-statistic is:

t = (x̄ − μ₀) / (s / √n)

Where:

• x̄ = sample mean
• μ₀ = hypothesized population mean
• s = sample standard deviation
• n = sample size

### What this ratio represents

Numerator:
• How far your sample mean is from the reference value

Denominator:
• How much natural noise you expect in sample means

So t answers:

> “How many standard errors away from the hypothesis is my sample?”

Large absolute t-values mean “this difference is hard to explain by randomness alone.”
