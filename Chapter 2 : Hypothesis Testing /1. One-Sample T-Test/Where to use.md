## 2. Why the t-Test Exists at All

If you knew the **true population standard deviation**, you would use a z-test.

In reality, you almost never do.

So the t-test exists to handle **extra uncertainty** introduced by estimating variability from the sample itself.

Key idea:

• Small samples fluctuate more
• The t-distribution accounts for this added instability
• As sample size grows, the t-distribution becomes the normal distribution

This is not a different test. It is a corrected one.
