## 5. Hypotheses: What You Are Actually Claiming

### Null Hypothesis (H₀)

The population mean equals the reference value.

H₀: μ = μ₀

### Alternative Hypotheses

Two-sided:
• μ ≠ μ₀
Used when any difference matters.

One-sided:
• μ > μ₀ or μ < μ₀
Used only when direction is justified before seeing data.

One-sided tests are stronger claims and easier to abuse. Use them sparingly.
