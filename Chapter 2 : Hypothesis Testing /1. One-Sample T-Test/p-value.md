## 6. p-Value: Correct Interpretation

The p-value is:

> The probability of observing a result at least as extreme as yours **if the null hypothesis were true**.

It is NOT:

• The probability the null hypothesis is true
• The probability your result happened by chance

A small p-value means:

• Your data is unlikely under the null
• The null hypothesis becomes implausible

Statistics does not prove truth. It eliminates bad explanations.
