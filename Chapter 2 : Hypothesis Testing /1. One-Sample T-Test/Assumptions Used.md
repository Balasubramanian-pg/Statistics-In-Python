## 7. Assumptions (And What Happens If You Break Them)

### Assumption 1: Independence

Observations must be independent.

Violation:
• Inflated significance
• False confidence

### Assumption 2: Approximate Normality of the Mean

Either:

• Data is roughly normal
• Or sample size is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply

Rule of thumb:
• n ≥ 30 often suffices
• Smaller samples require more scrutiny

### Assumption 3: No Extreme Outliers

Outliers disproportionately affect the mean and standard deviation.

If violated:
• Consider trimming
• Or use a non-parametric alternative (e.g., Wilcoxon signed-rank test)
