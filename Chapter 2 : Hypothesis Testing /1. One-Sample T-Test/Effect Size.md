## 8. Effect Size: What the t-Test Does Not Tell You

A statistically significant result can be practically meaningless.

You should almost always report an effect size:

### Cohen’s d

d = (x̄ − μ₀) / s

Interpretation (context-dependent):
• 0.2 → small
• 0.5 → medium
• 0.8 → large

The t-test answers “is there evidence?”
Effect size answers “does it matter?”
