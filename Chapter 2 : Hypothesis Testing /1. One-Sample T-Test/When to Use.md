## 1. What Problem the One-Sample t-Test Is Solving

You have:

• One sample of data
• A reference value (population mean, benchmark, target, SLA, historical average)

You want to know whether the difference you observe is:

• A real signal
• Or just random fluctuation

The test answers a narrow but powerful question:

> “Is my sample mean plausibly drawn from a population with this known mean?”

Not “are they equal,” but “is the observed difference too large to be explained by chance?”
