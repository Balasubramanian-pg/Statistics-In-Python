## 4. Degrees of Freedom (Why n − 1 Matters)

Degrees of freedom = n − 1

Why?

Because once you estimate the mean from the data, you lose one independent piece of information. The remaining variability has one less dimension to move freely.

Practical effect:

• Smaller samples → heavier tails → more conservative test
• Larger samples → tighter distribution → easier to detect differences

This is why small samples struggle to reach significance.
