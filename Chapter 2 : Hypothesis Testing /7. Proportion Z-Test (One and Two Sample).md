### **Proportion Z-Test (One and Two Sample)**

---

#### **1. One-Sample Proportion Z-Test**
**Purpose**: Tests whether the proportion of successes in a **single sample** differs from a **known or hypothesized population proportion**.

---

##### **When to Use**
- You have **one categorical variable** with two outcomes (e.g., success/failure, yes/no).
- You want to compare the **sample proportion** to a **known population proportion** (e.g., testing if 60% of customers prefer a new product vs. a known 50% benchmark).

---

##### **Assumptions**
- **Binary Data**: Only two possible outcomes.
- **Large Sample Size**: \( n \times p \geq 10 \) and \( n \times (1-p) \geq 10 \) (where \( p \) is the hypothesized proportion).
- **Independent Observations**: Each observation is independent.

---

##### **Hypotheses**
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: \( p = p_0 \) (sample proportion equals the hypothesized proportion).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**:
  - \( p \neq p_0 \) (two-tailed)
  - \( p > p_0 \) (one-tailed, right)
  - \( p < p_0 \) (one-tailed, left)

---

##### **Test Statistic**
\[
z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}}}
\]
- \(\hat{p}\): Sample proportion.
- \(p_0\): Hypothesized population proportion.
- \(n\): Sample size.

---

##### **Example**
Suppose you test if the proportion of people who prefer a new product (60 out of 100) is different from the known proportion of 50%:
- \(\hat{p} = 0.6\)
- \(p_0 = 0.5\)
- \(n = 100\)

\[
z = \frac{0.6 - 0.5}{\sqrt{\frac{0.5 \times 0.5}{100}}} = \frac{0.1}{0.05} = 2
\]

- **Critical z-value** (for \(\alpha = 0.05\), two-tailed): **±1.96**.
- Since \(2 > 1.96\), **reject \(H₀\)** (proportion is significantly different from 50%).

---

---

#### **2. Two-Sample Proportion Z-Test**
**Purpose**: Compares the proportions of successes in **two independent samples** to determine if they differ.

---

##### **When to Use**
- You have **two independent groups** (e.g., males vs. females, treatment vs. control).
- You want to test if the **proportions of success** differ between the groups.

---

##### **Assumptions**
- **Binary Data**: Only two outcomes.
- **Large Sample Sizes**: For both groups, \( n_1 \times p_1 \geq 10 \), \( n_1 \times (1-p_1) \geq 10 \), \( n_2 \times p_2 \geq 10 \), and \( n_2 \times (1-p_2) \geq 10 \).
- **Independent Samples**: No overlap between groups.

---

##### **Hypotheses**
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: \( p_1 = p_2 \) (proportions are equal).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**:
  - \( p_1 \neq p_2 \) (two-tailed)
  - \( p_1 > p_2 \) (one-tailed, right)
  - \( p_1 < p_2 \) (one-tailed, left)

---

##### **Test Statistic**
\[
z = \frac{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2}{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p}) \left( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right)}}
\]
- \(\hat{p}_1\) and \(\hat{p}_2\): Sample proportions.
- \(\hat{p}\): Pooled proportion:
  \[
  \hat{p} = \frac{X_1 + X_2}{n_1 + n_2}
  \]
  where \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are the number of successes in each group.

---

##### **Example**
Suppose you compare the proportion of smokers in two cities:
- **City A**: 40 smokers out of 100.
- **City B**: 30 smokers out of 100.

- \(\hat{p}_1 = 0.4\), \(\hat{p}_2 = 0.3\)
- \(\hat{p} = \frac{40 + 30}{100 + 100} = 0.35\)

\[
z = \frac{0.4 - 0.3}{\sqrt{0.35 \times 0.65 \times \left( \frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{100} \right)}} = \frac{0.1}{\sqrt{0.00455}} \approx 1.48
\]

- **Critical z-value** (for \(\alpha = 0.05\), two-tailed): **±1.96**.
- Since \(1.48 < 1.96\), **fail to reject \(H₀\)** (no significant difference in proportions).

---

### **Interpretation**
- **One-Sample**: If \( p \leq 0.05 \), the sample proportion is significantly different from the hypothesized value.
- **Two-Sample**: If \( p \leq 0.05 \), the proportions in the two groups are significantly different.

---

### **Limitations**
- Requires **large sample sizes** for validity.
- **Sensitive to small expected frequencies** (use **Fisher’s Exact Test** for small samples).
