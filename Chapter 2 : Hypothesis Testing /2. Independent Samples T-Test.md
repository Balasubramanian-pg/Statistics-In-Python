An **independent samples t-test** (also called a **two-sample t-test** or **unpaired t-test**) is used to determine whether the means of two independent groups are significantly different from each other. This test is commonly used in experiments where you compare two distinct groups, such as treatment vs. control, men vs. women, or two different populations.

---

## **When to Use an Independent Samples T-Test**
- You have **two independent groups** (e.g., Group A and Group B).
- You want to compare the **means of a continuous variable** between these groups.
- Your data is **normally distributed** (or the sample size is large enough, typically n > 30).
- The groups have **similar variances** (homogeneity of variance).

---

## **Key Assumptions**
1. **Independence**: The two groups should be independent of each other (no overlap or pairing).
2. **Normality**: The data in each group should be approximately normally distributed. For small samples, check normality using a Shapiro-Wilk test or Q-Q plots.
3. **Homogeneity of Variance**: The variances of the two groups should be equal. This can be tested using **Levene’s test**.

---

## **Hypotheses**
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The means of the two groups are equal.
  \( H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 \)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The means of the two groups are not equal.
  \( H_1: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2 \) (two-tailed)
  \( H_1: \mu_1 > \mu_2 \) (one-tailed, right)
  \( H_1: \mu_1 < \mu_2 \) (one-tailed, left)

---

## **Steps to Perform an Independent Samples T-Test**
1. **State your hypotheses** (null and alternative).
2. **Set the significance level (α)**, usually 0.05.
3. **Check assumptions** (normality and homogeneity of variance).
4. **Calculate the t-statistic**:
   - If variances are equal (pooled variance):
     \[
     t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{2}{n}}}
     \]
     where \( s_p \) is the pooled standard deviation:
     \[
     s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}
     \]
   - If variances are unequal (Welch’s t-test):
     \[
     t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}
     \]
5. **Determine the degrees of freedom (df)**:
   - For equal variances: \( df = n_1 + n_2 - 2 \)
   - For unequal variances: Use Welch-Satterthwaite equation.
6. **Compare the t-statistic to the critical value** or calculate the p-value.
7. **Make a decision**:
   - If \( p \leq \alpha \), reject the null hypothesis.
   - If \( p > \alpha \), fail to reject the null hypothesis.

## **Example**
Suppose you want to compare the average test scores of two groups: Group A (n=30, mean=85, SD=10) and Group B (n=30, mean=80, SD=12).

1. **Check assumptions**: Assume normality and equal variances.
2. **Calculate pooled standard deviation**:
   \[
   s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(30-1)(10)^2 + (30-1)(12)^2}{30 + 30 - 2}} = \sqrt{\frac{2900 + 4176}{58}} \approx 11.13
   \]
3. **Calculate t-statistic**:
   \[
   t = \frac{85 - 80}{11.13 \sqrt{\frac{2}{30}}} \approx \frac{5}{2.97} \approx 1.68
   \]
4. **Compare to critical value** (for \( df = 58 \) and \( \alpha = 0.05 \), two-tailed) or find the p-value.

---

## **Interpretation**
- If the p-value is **less than 0.05**, you conclude that the means of the two groups are significantly different.
- If the p-value is **greater than 0.05**, you do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

---

## **Limitations**
- Sensitive to outliers.
- Assumes normality and equal variances (unless using Welch’s t-test).
