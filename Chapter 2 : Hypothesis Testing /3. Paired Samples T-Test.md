### **Paired Samples T-Test**

A **paired samples t-test** (or **dependent t-test**) compares the means of two related measurements taken from the same subjects or matched pairs. It’s used when you want to analyze changes or differences within the same group, such as before-and-after measurements, repeated measures, or matched pairs.

---

### **When to Use a Paired Samples T-Test**
- You have **two related measurements** for each subject (e.g., pre-test and post-test scores, twin studies, or matched pairs).
- You want to test if the **average difference** between the two measurements is significantly different from zero.
- Your data is **normally distributed** (or the sample size is large enough).

---

### **Key Assumptions**
- **Dependence**: The two measurements are related (e.g., same subjects or matched pairs).
- **Normality**: The **differences** between the paired measurements should be approximately normally distributed.
- **Continuous Data**: The variable should be measured on an interval or ratio scale.

---

### **Hypotheses**
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The average difference between the paired measurements is zero.
  \( H_0: \mu_d = 0 \)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The average difference is not zero.
  \( H_1: \mu_d \neq 0 \) (two-tailed)
  \( H_1: \mu_d > 0 \) (one-tailed, right)
  \( H_1: \mu_d < 0 \) (one-tailed, left)

---

### **Steps to Perform a Paired Samples T-Test**
1. **State your hypotheses** (null and alternative).
2. **Set the significance level (α)**, usually 0.05.
3. **Calculate the differences** between each pair of measurements.
4. **Check normality** of the differences (e.g., using a Shapiro-Wilk test or Q-Q plot).
5. **Calculate the t-statistic**:
   \[
   t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}
   \]
   - \(\bar{d}\): Mean of the differences
   - \(s_d\): Standard deviation of the differences
   - \(n\): Number of pairs
6. **Determine the degrees of freedom (df)**: \( df = n - 1 \)
7. **Compare the t-statistic to the critical value** or calculate the p-value.
8. **Make a decision**:
   - If \( p \leq \alpha \), reject the null hypothesis.
   - If \( p > \alpha \), fail to reject the null hypothesis.

### **Example**
Suppose you measure blood pressure before and after a treatment for 10 patients:

| Patient | Before (A) | After (B) | Difference (A - B) |
|---------|------------|-----------|--------------------|
| 1       | 140        | 130       | 10                 |
| 2       | 150        | 145       | 5                  |
| 3       | 130        | 125       | 5                  |
| ...     | ...        | ...       | ...                |

- Mean difference (\(\bar{d}\)) = 7
- Standard deviation of differences (\(s_d\)) = 3
- Number of pairs (\(n\)) = 10

\[
t = \frac{7}{3 / \sqrt{10}} \approx \frac{7}{0.95} \approx 7.37
\]

Compare this t-value to the critical value (for \( df = 9 \) and \( \alpha = 0.05 \), two-tailed) or find the p-value.

---

### **Interpretation**
- If the p-value is **less than 0.05**, the average difference is statistically significant.
- If the p-value is **greater than 0.05**, there is no significant difference.

---

### **Limitations**
- Sensitive to outliers in the differences.
- Assumes normality of the differences.
