# Measures of Dispersion in Real Estate Data

Here's Python code to analyze price variability between two neighborhoods using standard deviation and IQR:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create synthetic real estate data for two neighborhoods
np.random.seed(42)

# Neighborhood A - more consistent pricing
normal_a = np.random.normal(loc=400000, scale=50000, size=450)
luxury_a = np.random.normal(loc=800000, scale=100000, size=50)
prices_a = np.concatenate([normal_a, luxury_a])

# Neighborhood B - more variable pricing
normal_b = np.random.normal(loc=350000, scale=100000, size=400)
luxury_b = np.random.normal(loc=1200000, scale=300000, size=100)
prices_b = np.concatenate([normal_b, luxury_b])

# Create DataFrame
real_estate = pd.DataFrame({
    'Price': np.concatenate([prices_a, prices_b]),
    'Neighborhood': ['A']*500 + ['B']*500
})

# Calculate dispersion measures for each neighborhood
dispersion_stats = real_estate.groupby('Neighborhood')['Price'].agg([
    ('Count', 'count'),
    ('Mean', 'mean'),
    ('Std Dev', 'std'),
    ('Variance', 'var'),
    ('IQR', lambda x: np.percentile(x, 75) - np.percentile(x, 25)),
    ('Range', lambda x: x.max() - x.min())
]).round(2)

print("Dispersion Measures by Neighborhood:")
print(dispersion_stats)

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Boxplot comparing neighborhoods
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.boxplot(x='Neighborhood', y='Price', data=real_estate)
plt.title('Price Distribution by Neighborhood')
plt.ylabel('Price ($)')

# Violin plot showing density and dispersion
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.violinplot(x='Neighborhood', y='Price', data=real_estate)
plt.title('Price Density and Dispersion')
plt.ylabel('Price ($)')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Interpretation
print("\nKey Observations:")
print("1. Neighborhood B has higher standard deviation ($", dispersion_stats.loc['B', 'Std Dev'], 
      "vs $", dispersion_stats.loc['A', 'Std Dev'], ") indicating more price variability")
print("2. Neighborhood B has larger IQR ($", dispersion_stats.loc['B', 'IQR'], 
      "vs $", dispersion_stats.loc['A', 'IQR'], ") showing a wider middle 50% price range")
print("3. The boxplots visually confirm Neighborhood B has more spread-out prices")
```

## Key Features of This Analysis:

1. **Dispersion Metrics Calculated**:
   - Standard deviation (shows average distance from mean)
   - Variance (squared standard deviation)
   - IQR (range of middle 50% of data)
   - Range (total spread from min to max)

2. **Visual Comparisons**:
   - Boxplots clearly show the IQR differences
   - Violin plots combine boxplot with density visualization

3. **Key Insights**:
   - Neighborhood B shows greater price variability in all measures
   - The IQR is particularly useful for comparing typical price ranges
   - Standard deviation helps quantify how much prices vary from the average

4. **Why These Measures Matter**:
   - Standard deviation helps assess investment risk
   - IQR shows the price range where most homes fall
   - Together they tell us Neighborhood B has both more affordable options and more luxury homes

To use with real data, simply replace the synthetic data generation with:
```python
real_estate = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
```
