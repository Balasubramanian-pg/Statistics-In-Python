Descriptive statistics use two main types of measures to summarize a data set.

## Measures of Central Tendency

These values indicate the **center** point or typical value around which data clusters.

* **Mean:** The arithmetic **average**. It is the sum of all values divided by the total number of values. It is affected by extreme values (outliers).
* **Median:** The **middle** value in a data set when it is arranged in order. It separates the upper 50% from the lower 50% of the data. It is less sensitive to outliers than the mean.
* **Mode:** The value that appears **most often** in a data set. A set can have one mode, multiple modes, or no mode.

## Measures of Dispersion (Variability)

These values describe the **spread** or scattering of the data points from the center.

* **Range:** The difference between the **highest** value and the **lowest** value. It is the simplest measure of spread.
* **Variance:** The **average** of the squared differences from the mean. It quantifies how much values differ from the mean.
* **Standard Deviation:** The **square root** of the variance. It measures the typical distance between data points and the mean, expressed in the original units of the data.
* **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The difference between the third quartile (**Q3**) and the first quartile (**Q1**). It measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.
