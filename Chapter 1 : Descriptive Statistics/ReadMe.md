Descriptive statistics describe the **basic features** of data collected in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures.

## Primary Uses

* **Quantitative Research:** Used to summarize **numerical** data.
* **Initial Data Review:** The first step in analyzing data, before using inferential statistics.

## Key Types of Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics fall into two main categories. 
### Measures of Central Tendency

These describe the **center** point of a data set, showing where most values fall.

* **Mean (Average):** The sum of all values divided by the number of values.
* **Median:** The **middle** value when the data set is ordered from least to greatest.
* **Mode:** The value that appears **most often** in a data set.

### Measures of Variability (Spread)

These describe how **spread out** or dispersed the data values are.

* **Range:** The difference between the **highest** and **lowest** values.
* **Variance:** The **average** of the squared differences from the Mean.
* **Standard Deviation:** The **square root** of the variance. It shows the typical distance between data points and the Mean.
